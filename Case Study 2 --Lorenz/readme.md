# Case Study 2
In this case we attempt to reconstruct the dynamics of a chaotic system described by the well-known Lorenz equations.  The dynamics vastly differ depending on the initial conditions and model parameters, yet, using limited training samples, the limit cycles and other main characteristics are adequately captured.
